-- We define the type PDA as follows:
-- It consists of a tripple
-- Integer gives the start state
-- [Integer] gives the accepting (or final) states
-- [Transition] gives the transitions of the pushdown (PDA instructions)
type PDA = (Integer,[Integer],[Transition])

-- Describing the PDA transitions
-- Each transistion has a pair (a tuple)
-- In the first tuple:
-- Integer gives the current state
-- The first string gives the next character of the input
-- The second string gives the character at the top of the stack

-- Defining instructions of the PDA
-- In the second tuple:
-- The Integer gives the new state
-- String gives the new character to be pushed onto the stack
type Transition = ((Integer,String,String),(Integer,String))

-- Represents the computation steps to solve the PDA
-- Configuartion of the PDA as follows:
-- The Integer is the current state (starting configuartion)
-- First string is the remaining input
-- Second string is the contents of the stack (empty at the start)
type Configuration = (Integer,String,String)

-- The result produced by the PDA follows:
-- Indicates whether or not the initial input string is accepted or rejected
-- Adding deriving Show allows the resulst to be printed
data Result = Accept | Reject deriving Show

-- used to test if a PDA accepts or rejects a string
-- takes a PDA as an input (start and final state with instructions)
-- a string to test for acceptance
-- outputs a representation of result (Accept or Reject)
-- String is already in the prelude
-- We have to define PDA and Result
