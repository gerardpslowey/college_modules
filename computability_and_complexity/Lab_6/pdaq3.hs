-- Design a pushdown automaton abc to accept the language {w âˆˆ {a,b,c}* | the number of c's is equal to the number of a's plus the number of b's}. 
-- This pushdown automaton should accept the following strings:
 
-- ""
-- "cabc"
-- "cacbca"
-- "aabbcccc"
-- "acbcbcac"
 
-- And reject the following strings:
 
-- "a"
-- "abc"
-- "cacbcac"

-- check (a+b) against c 
-- order of the a's, b's and c's doesn't matter
