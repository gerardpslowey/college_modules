# user-interface-clubs-and-socs

Designing and developing a User Interface for a Clubs & Socs Events Timetable.  
Progress was initially developed using the folder 'static_site' but we moved  
our development to 'dynamic_site'. The static site remains in the repo but is no  
longer used. You can see that we used React to deploy our dynamic site.
