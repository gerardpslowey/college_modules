"""
implenting the appointments using lists and tuples.
days is a list of all days in the week.
each of the days in the week is a list of tuples.
each of the tuples in a day contains the start time of the appointment @ pos 0 and the end time @ pos 1.

as a result of this times cannot be changed unless they are removed and the desired edited time is added

the time works off the 24 hr clock.

eg an appointment booked for 5pm until 7 pm on a Friday
   an appointment booked for 3am until 4 am on a Tuesday
   and an appointment booked for 10am until 1pm on a Tuesday

Tue = [(3,4),(10,13)]
Fri = [(17,19)]
